[AssetBundles - Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetBundlesIntro.html)

> **Note:** Unity now provides [Addressables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@latest) as a high-level API to manage remote content. It is recommended to use Addressables instead of handling AssetBundles manually in most cases.
